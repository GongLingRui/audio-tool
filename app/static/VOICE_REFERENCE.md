## V. Working Rules for Voice Description Prompts

1. **Lead with register** (bass, baritone, tenor, alto, mezzo-soprano, soprano)
2. **Add 2-3 texture/timbre terms** from Section I only
3. **Never mix acoustic (Section I) and behavioral (Section II-IV) descriptors** in the description field
4. **Use `instruct` for delivery, emotion, and pacing** — that's what it's for
5. **Prefer "control" terms** (`silky`, `even`, `precise`, `firm`) over "energy" terms (`bright`, `sharp`, `piercing`) for consistency
6. **Over-specifying with ambiguous terms compounds uncertainty** — minimal clear descriptions can outperform detailed ambiguous ones
7. **Female voices are inherently more consistent** in this model across all description styles

### Voice Description Examples

**Good (Anatomy-first):**
- "female alto, full grounded mid-range, slightly husky, natural warmth"
- "male bass, dark authoritative rumble, heavy low-end, firm tone"
- "female mezzo-soprano, silky even tone, soft rounded edges, gentle clarity"

**Bad (Mixed acoustic/behavioral):**
- "A cheerful male tenor" ❌
- "deep voice speaking rapidly" ❌
- "A narrator reading calmly" ❌

### Instruct Field Examples

**Good (Delivery/Emotion):**
- "sad, resigned, melancholy tone with measured pacing"
- "energetic, urgent, rapid-fire delivery with punchy emphasis"
- "calm, reassuring, steady with gentle warmth"

**Bad (Acoustic descriptions):**
- "deep, resonant voice" ❌ (put in description instead)
- "bright, clear tone" ❌ (put in description instead)
